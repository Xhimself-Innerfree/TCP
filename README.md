This is a global TCP communication demo made by Flavin Neuromachine Lab (https://flavinlab.io/)
You can find the source code of the TCP Server running on the cloud server here (./TCP/Linux_TCP/Server_v2.c), the source code of the TCP Client running on your Windows PC here (./TCP/TCP_Client/main.cpp)
the executable file (./TCP/x64/Debug/TCP_Client.exe)
run it and type in the public IPv4, then you are connected to the TCP Server
wait for someone else to join or you can open two clients on your machine and talk to yourself.
the TCP server will broadcast every message any client sent to every other clients connected
People can talk here globally
